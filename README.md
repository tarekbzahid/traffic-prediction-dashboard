# Traffic Prediction Dashboard

🚦 **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Prediction Platform**

This project visualizes live traffic sensor data from Las Vegas, predicts future traffic conditions using trained AI models, and provides interactive map and graph interfaces.

---

## 📍 Current Focus

- Plotting sensor locations on a live map (Leaflet.js).
- Receiving live traffic sensor data (15-minute intervals).
- Preparing backend for model-driven future predictions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: Leaflet.js (map), Chart.js (graphs)
- **AI Models**: PyTorch
- **Data Source**: Live traffic sensors
